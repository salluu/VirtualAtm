Intro:

This is meant to be a very simple ~ 30 min exercise. If you find yourself creating more than 10 classes or spending more than two hours on it please assume that you're trying to do too much. There are no hidden traps, weâ€™d just like to get a very small sample of your coding style. There will be a pair programming interview a later round to really shine.

Task:

Implement a very basic virtual cash card in C#.

Requirements:

1. Can withdraw money if a valid pin is supplied. The balance on the card needs to adjust accordingly.

2. Can be topped up any time by an arbitrary amount.

3. The cash card, being virtual, can be used in many places at the same time.

Principles:

1. Well tested code (test driven would be best)

2. Write the code as you would write a part of a production grade system
